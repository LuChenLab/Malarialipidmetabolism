This repository includes:

1. üìä **Malaria Lipid Metabolism Analysis** ‚Äî A computational pipeline based on single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq to identify conserved lipid metabolism-related genes in *Plasmodium* species and prioritize functional candidates for downstream validation.

2. ü§ñ **MRS (Metabolism-Related Score) R Package** ‚Äî A machine learning framework built on Spy-PU learning (Spy-based positive-unlabeled learning), designed for gene classification in datasets containing only positive samples. Includes model comparison, feature selection, and final model training.

## üìä 1. Malaria Lipid Metabolism Analysis

We jointly analyzed scRNA-seq data from *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium berghei* IDC stages. A lipid metabolism gene, **CAP**, was identified and shown to regulate phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis via interaction with host CTL1.

## ü§ñ 2. MRS: Metabolism-Related Score Model

MRS is a machine learning package built on [`caret`](https://github.com/topepo/caret), designed for binary classification problems where only **positive samples** are available.

It implements a **Spy-PU learning** pipeline to identify reliable negatives, compares 10 classifiers, supports ablation-based feature selection, and provides end-to-end model evaluation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Spy-PU learning with tunable parameters
- Model comparison (XGBoost, RF, SVM, etc.)
- Feature selection via ablation (optional)
- Final model tuning + performance visualization

## üíª Environment & Dependencies
The MRS package was developed under R version 4.0.2, and depends on core packages including caret, pROC, PRROC, and doParallel, among others. Please refer to the package DESCRIPTION file for a complete list and version requirements.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```r
# Install from source
devtools::install_local("MRS_1.0.0.tar.gz")

# Step 1: Prepare data
prep <- Prepare_classification_data(my_data)

# Step 2 (optional): PU-learning
pu_data <- Identify_reliable_negatives(prep$trainData, spy_ratio = 0.3, threshold_quantile = 0.05)

# Step 3: Train and compare models
models <- Train_multiple_models(prepared_data = prep)

# Step 4: Evaluate training performance
train_eval <- Evaluate_train_performance(models, prepared_data = prep)

# Step 5: Evaluate test performance
test_eval <- Evaluate_test_performance(models, prepared_data = prep)

# Step 6 (optional): Feature selection
fs_result <- Feature_selection_ablation(prepared_data = prep, model_name = "XGBoost")

# Step 7: Final tuning
final_model <- Tune_model_eval("XGBoost", prepared_data = fs_result)

# Step 8: Plotting
# PR Curve
Plot_pr_curves(final_model$train_pr_list, final_model$test_pr, title = "Precision-Recall Curves")

# ROC Curve
Plot_roc_curves(final_model$train_roc_list, final_model$test_roc, title = "ROC Curves")
```
