# Malaria Lipid Metabolism Analysis & MRS R Package

> **Note**: All analyses and the development of the MRS package were conducted using **R version 4.0.2**, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility within this environment.

This repository includes:

1. 📊 **Malaria Lipid Metabolism Analysis** — A computational pipeline based on single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq to identify conserved lipid metabolism-related genes in *Plasmodium* species and prioritize functional candidates for downstream validation.

2. 🤖 **MRS (Metabolism-Related Score) R Package** — A machine learning framework built on Spy-PU learning (Spy-based positive-unlabeled learning), designed for gene classification in datasets containing only positive samples. Includes model comparison, feature selection, and final model training.

## 📊 1. Malaria Lipid Metabolism Analysis

We jointly analyzed scRNA-seq data from *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium berghei* IDC stages. A lipid metabolism gene, **CAP**, was identified and shown to regulate phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis via interaction with host CTL1.

## 🤖 2. MRS: Metabolism-Related Score Model

MRS is a machine learning package built on [`caret`](https://github.com/topepo/caret), tailored for positive-only binary classification tasks.  
All source files and detailed function documentation are available in the `/MRS_package` folder.

It implements a **Spy-PU learning** pipeline to identify reliable negatives, compares 10 classifiers, supports ablation-based feature selection, and provides end-to-end model evaluation.

### ⚙️ Key Features

- Spy-PU learning with tunable parameters
- Model comparison (XGBoost, RF, SVM, etc.)
- Feature selection via ablation (optional)
- Final model tuning + performance visualization

## 💻 Environment & Dependencies
The MRS package was developed under R version 4.0.2, and depends on core packages including caret, pROC, PRROC, and doParallel, among others. Please refer to the package DESCRIPTION file for a complete list and version requirements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```r
# Install from source
devtools::install_local("MRS_1.0.0.tar.gz")

# Step 1: Find optimal PU-learning parameters using spy strategy
pu_param <- Tune_spy_pu(data = my_data)

# Step 2: Identify reliable negatives using selected PU-learning parameters
pu_data <- Identify_reliable_negatives(data = my_data)

# Step 3: Prepare training and testing datasets
prep <- Prepare_classification_data(pu_data)

# Step 4: Train and compare multiple models, evaluate performance
models <- Train_multiple_models(prepared_data = prep)

# Evaluate training performance across models
train_eval <- Evaluate_train_performance(models, prepared_data = prep)

# Evaluate test performance across models
test_eval <- Evaluate_test_performance(models, prepared_data = prep)

# Step 5 (Optional): Perform feature ablation to identify key predictors
fs_result <- Feature_selection_ablation(prepared_data = prep, model_name = "XX")

# Step 6: Tune hyperparameters and finalize best model
final_model <- Tune_model_eval(prepared_data = fs_result, model_name = "XX")

# Plot AUROC and AUPRC curves
Plot_roc_curves(final_model$train_roc_list, final_model$test_roc, title = "ROC Curves")
Plot_pr_curves(final_model$train_pr_list, final_model$test_pr, title = "Precision-Recall Curves")
```
